This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

CHapter 7 Notes and Exercises 

exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

 key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions
 Ex. of question types:  
What type of variation occurs within my variables?  
What type of covariation occurs between my variables?  

**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement.  

A variable is **categorical** if it can only take one of a small set of values.  
- To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, use a bar chart  

A variable is **continuous** if it can take any of an infinite set of ordered values. Numbers and date-times are two examples of continuous variables.   
- To examine the distribution of a continuous variable, use a histogram  

To use many histograms in same plot...
 geom_freqpoly() instead of geom_histogram().     
 - uses lines  
 
 **7.3.4 Exercises**
```{r}
summary(select(diamonds, x, y, z))
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = x), binwidth = 0.01) #to look at x variable
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.01) #to look at y variable
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = z), binwidth = 0.01) #to look at z variable
head(diamonds)
```
 Based on this the data is right skewed and z has the smallest range of values.
 
```{r}
ggplot(filter(diamonds, price < 2500), aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, center = 0)
ggplot(filter(diamonds, price < 2500), aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, center = 0)
ggplot(filter(diamonds, price < 2500), aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, center = 0)
```
Based on this, most diamonds are priced between $500 and $750 and no diamonds are priced at $1500.

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(carat >= 0.99, carat <= 1) %>%
  count(carat)
```

 Only 23 diamonds are 0.99 carat whereas 1558 diamonds are 1.00 carat.
 
 
 
 
 **7.4**
 
 If you have unusual points in your data you can remove whole row (not recommended bc some values may be valid) or just replace the unusual values with missing values.    
 ex. diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y))  
  use the ifelse() fcn to do this  
  
  ggplot will automatically removed missing values and will show warning message. To suppress that warning, set na.rm = TRUE:   
  
  Or you can make missing values into new variable with is.na().  
  
  7.4 Exercises 
  In histogram, missing values are removed and ggplot shows warning message but just graphs without the variables
  In boxplot, missing values act like another category. 
  na.rm = TRUE removes NA values and doesn't include them in the mean and the sum 
  
  **7.5**
  covariation describes the behavior between variables   
  ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +
  coord_flip()  
  coord_flip() flips the boxplot horizontally   
  
  
  
```{r}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = sched_dep_time))
```
  
  
  
  To visualise the covariation between categorical variables, you’ll need to count the number of observations for each combination.  
  geom_count(): 
  
  
```{r}

nycflights13::flights %>%
  group_by(month, dest) %>%
  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = dest, fill = dep_delay)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Destination", fill = "Departure Delay")

nycflights13::flights %>%
  group_by(month, dest) %>%
  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  filter(n() == 12) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(dest = reorder(dest, dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = dest, fill = dep_delay)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Destination", fill = "Departure Delay")
```
  
 Draw a visualization btwn two continuous variables with a scatterplot geom_point()   
 
 Scatterplots become less useful as the size of your dataset grows, because points begin to overplot, and pile up into areas of uniform black (as above). You’ve already seen one way to fix the problem: using the alpha aesthetic to add transparency.
 
 
```{r}
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(color = cut_number(carat, 5), x = price)
) +
  geom_freqpoly() +
  labs(x = "Price", y = "Count", color = "Carat")
```
 
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut_number(price, 10), y = carat)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Price")
```
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(color = cut_number(carat, 5), y = price, x = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
